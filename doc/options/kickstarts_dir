Default: [base_dir]/Kickstarts
Example: path/to/dir/with/kickstarts

The following directory is scanned for kickstart ROMs, and kickstart file
names are looked up relative to this directory. If you do not specify
this path, and do have kickstarts in the default directory, you need to
provide the path for a specific kickstart in [kickstart_file].

FS-UAE uses WinUAE’s quickstart code for this, so if you haven’t got exactly
the preferred ROM files the automatic configuration will fail. You should use
[kickstart_file]/[kickstart_ext_file] instead in this case.

The default is (My) Documents/FS-UAE/Kickstarts

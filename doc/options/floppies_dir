Default: [base_dir]/Floppies

Search for (relative) floppy image paths relative to this dir (in addition
to current directory).

This means that if you have a floppy image "Test.adf" in the Floppies
directory, you can for example simply set [floppy_drive_0] = Test.adf (without
including the directory path).

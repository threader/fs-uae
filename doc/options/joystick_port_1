Example: SPEED-LINK COMPETITION PRO #2

The device connected to port 1. If not specified, a the first
joystick/gamepad connected to the computer will be used, if the
joystick/gamepad is supported. Otherwise it defaults to keyboard emulation
(cursor keys + right CTRL). To force keyboard emulation, specify "keyboard".

You can also choose to use specific gamepads/joysticks in the ports. In this
case, you specify the device names. If you have more than one device of the
same model, the second is referred to by appending a space and #2 (and so on).
The device names are case insensitive.

To force specific joystick devices in both joystick ports, you configure
something like this: 

  joystick_port_0 = SPEED-LINK COMPETITION PRO #2
  joystick_port_1 = LOGITECH CORDLESS RUMBLEPAD 2 USB

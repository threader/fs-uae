Description: Relax host CPU usage when using fastest-possible CPU
Example: 3
Default:
Range: 0 - 10
Type: integer

When using fastest-possible CPU mode, the UAE core will, without idling,
use as much host CPU as possible. This setting controls how often UAE
performs a short sleep when 68000 STOP instructions are executed.

The default value for fastest-possible mode is 2. For exact or approximate
CPU speeds, cpu_idle is not used.

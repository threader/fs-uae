* Opening the F12 menu / Using the modifier key causes FS-UAE to blink
  on Windows due to ungrabbing input (might have to disable this feature
  on Windows).

* When internal kickstart is being used and kickstart_file = internal
  was not used, show GUI message "Using AROS kickstart replacement".

* Amiga key sticks when opening/closing FS-UAE menu with modifier+F12
